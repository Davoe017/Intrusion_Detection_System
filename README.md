# Intrusion_Detection_System
This project employs the use of Python's Django web framework to build an intrusion detection system classifier.
A model was trained using the IDS_Data1.csv and saved as IDSmodel.h5, which was used in the web framework to build the classifier.
The IDS_model_training.py file contains all the code used for data preprocessing, and building the model.
The following libraries will be needed to carry out this project: Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn.
